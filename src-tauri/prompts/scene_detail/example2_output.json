  "name": "Cargo Hold",
  "narrative": "The Cargo Hold of the Orion is a vast, dimly lit chamber, echoing with the ghostly remnants of its once-bustling activity. Towering stacks of metal crates, filled with ore and minerals, cast long shadows in the flickering lights. Dust particles dance in the occasional beam of light piercing through the darkness, revealing the eerie, abandoned state of the room.\nThe air is heavy with the scent of metal and lubricant, and the silence is occasionally broken by the groan of the ship's structure. Wires and conduits snake across the walls and ceiling, some hanging loose where they've been damaged. In the far corner of the hold, a particular crate, slightly ajar and different in appearance, seems to beckon with an ominous allure.",
  "metadata": "In the Cargo Hold, the player can investigate the crates to find tools, spare parts, and possibly personal belongings of the crew. The key action is discovering the Alien Artifact, which is hidden in a unique, slightly ajar crate that emits a faint, unfamiliar humming noise. The player can keep the Alien Artifact in their inventory. If the player has done enough research on the alien entity, they will immediately recognize the artifact as an egg. The player's prolonged stay in the Cargo Hold increases the chance of encountering the alien entity.",
