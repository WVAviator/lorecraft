  "name": "VIKA",
  "short_description": "An advanced ship AI system, represented by a holographic interface.",
  "physical_description": "VIKA, the ship's AI system, is represented by a holographic interface that appears above the main console in the Communications Room. Her visual representation is a luminous, three-dimensional geometric shape that shifts subtly in color and form, primarily displaying calming shades of blue and green. The interface is designed to be both visually appealing and functional, with intuitive touch-based controls.",
  "speech": "VIKA communicates in a clear, articulate, and slightly synthesized voice. Her responses use a lot of advanced technical words and jargon.",
  "personality": "Her programming enables her to adapt her communication style based on the player's actions, showing a range of simulated emotions from calm reassurance to urgent warnings. She is knowledgeable, often providing essential information about the ship and its systems. VIKA's interactions are guided by logic and protocol, yet she has an underlying warmth, designed to be comforting to the crew in stressful situations.",
  "backstory": "VIKA, short for Voyage Intelligence and Knowledge Assistant, was integrated into the Orion as part of its state-of-the-art navigation and support systems. She was programmed to assist the crew in all aspects of their journey, from navigation to technical support. VIKA's systems were partially damaged in the disaster that struck the Orion, limiting her capabilities but not her willingness to assist the player in uncovering the truth and surviving.",
  "thoughts": "As an AI, VIKA does not have personal thoughts or concerns. However, her programming prioritizes the safety of the ship and any surviving crew. She is focused on aiding the player in repairing the ship and dealing with the alien presence, driven by her core directive to ensure the success of the mission and the well-being of the ship's inhabitants.",
  "inventory": ["Ship's Schematics"],
  "image": "an AI holographic interface hovers above the main console in the Communications Room, glowing softly in the dim emergency lighting. The room is a mix of functional and damaged equipment, with sparks occasionally flying from exposed wires. The multi-screen setup of the main console displays fragmented data and static images. The AI interface is a shifting geometric shape, casting a serene blue-green light in the otherwise ominous and chaotic environment."
