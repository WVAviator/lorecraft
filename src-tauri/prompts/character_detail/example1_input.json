The settlement is comprised of a dozen or so thatched roof huts, constructed mainly from local timber and mud, with smoke lazily rising from stone chimneys. The villagers, skilled in foraging and traditional crafts, share a deep connection with the forest, respecting its mysterious forces.\nA narrow, winding path leads into the heart of the village, flanked by small, carefully-tended gardens bursting with hardy vegetables and herbs. At the village center stands a venerable old tree, believed by the locals to be the guardian of the village. Intricate, primitive carvings on the tree depict legends of the Whispering Wood.",
