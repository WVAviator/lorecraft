summary: >
  Echoes of the Ancients is a game that takes place in a forgotten world,
  where the player must explore ancient ruins and uncover lost secrets to save
  their world from a looming disaster. The player will explore the Whispering
  Woods, a mystical forest filled with ancient ruins and artifacts, and will
  learn about the ancients and their lost civilization. The player will then
  venture into the Temple of Shadows, an ancient temple where a dark power is
  said to reside. The player will first build their survival skills in the
  Whispering Wood in order to obtain a map of the Temple of Shadows from Arin,
  the Keeper of Lore. The player will then use the map to navigate the Temple of
  Shadows, avoiding traps and solving puzzles to uncover the temple's secrets.
  The player will also find books, runes, and artifacts that will improve their
  Mystical Affinity and Ancient Wisdom abilities. The player must then use their
  Mystical Affinity to find the Echo Crystal in a cave beneath the temple and
  return it to the Altar of Ancients to restore balance to the world.

    description: A mystical forest said to be the home of ancient spirits. The
      Whispering Woods is filled with ancient ruins and artifacts, and is the
      starting point of the player's journey.
    significance: >
      The Whispering Woods is where the player first encounters Arin,
      the Keeper of Lore, who provides crucial information about their quest.
      It's also a place for early exploration and survival skill-building. The
      player will practice their survival skills by building fires, hunting or
      gathering food, and exploring before venturing into the Temple of Shadows.
  - name: Temple of Shadows
    description: An ancient temple where the dark power is said to reside.
    significance: >
      The temple is filled with traps and puzzles, and the player must
      use their wits and wisdom to navigate the temple and uncover its secrets.
      The player must have a map of the temple to successfully navigate the
      complex interior. The player will also need to find books, runes, and
      artifacts to improve their Mystical Affinity and Ancient Wisdom abilities.
      Some clues will only be revealed if Ancient Wisdom is high enough, and
      some traps can only be avoided if Mystical Affinity is high enough. The
      player will eventually discover that the ominous threat to the world is
      not caused by a dark and evil entity as some of the lore suggests - but is
      instead caused by an imbalance created when the Echo Crystal was removed
      from its resting place on the Altar of Ancients. This is hinted at in
      murals and texts but is only fully revealed once the player uncovers
      enough information in the Temple of Shadows. The player must then use
      their Mystical Affinity to find the Echo Crystal in a cave beneath the
      temple and return it to the Altar of Ancients to restore balance to the
      world.
