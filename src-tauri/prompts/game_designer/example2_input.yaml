summary: >
  In Derelict: The Orion's Fate, players find themselves as the sole
  survivor aboard the Orion, a mining ship stranded in an uncharted region of
  space. The game begins as the player awakens from cryosleep after an unknown
  disaster. They must navigate through claustrophobic corridors, solve the
  mystery of the crew's disappearance, repair critical systems, and contend with
  hostile alien entities that have infiltrated the ship. The player will improve
  their Engineering Expertise, Combat Training, and Alien Research as they
  uncover logs of what transpired, fend off alien threats, and decipher alien
  technology. Eventually, the player must restore the ship's mainframe, reignite
  the auxillary shuttle engines for a daring escape, or send a distress signal
  to call for rescue. Their attempts to survive and escape will be complicated
  by the presence of an insidious alien entity that has taken over the ship, and
  the player must learn how to use the Alien Artifact, which turns out be the
  alien's egg, to threaten the alien entity and force it to retreat.
