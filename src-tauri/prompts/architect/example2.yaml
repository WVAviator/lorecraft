summary: "In Derelict: The Orion's Fate, players find themselves as the sole survivor aboard the Orion, a mining ship stranded in an uncharted region of space. The game begins as the player awakens from cryosleep after an unknown disaster. They must navigate through claustrophobic corridors, solve the mystery of the crew's disappearance, repair critical systems, and contend with hostile alien entities that have infiltrated the ship. The player will improve their Engineering Expertise, Combat Training, and Alien Research as they uncover logs of what transpired, fend off alien threats, and decipher alien technology. Eventually, the player must restore the ship's mainframe, reignite the auxillary shuttle engines for a daring escape, or send a distress signal to call for rescue. Their attempts to survive and escape will be complicated by the presence of an insidious alien entity that has taken over the ship, and the player must learn how to use the Alien Artifact, which turns out be the alien's egg, to threaten the alien entity and force it to retreat."

win_condition: The player wins by repairing the engines on the escape shuttle and launching it to safety, or by sending a distress signal to call for rescue.
